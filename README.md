## progress of how the pipeline changes and how logistic regression can be used to detect spindles in EEG channel data

Pipelines for analyzing EEG data and detect spindls, sleeping stages, and k-complex. 

## Entering the phase using threshold detection algorithm to detect spindles in 6 EEG channels. 
 1. Threshold detection algorithm
 2. ASI capturing alpha,beta,spindle activity in terms of power density
